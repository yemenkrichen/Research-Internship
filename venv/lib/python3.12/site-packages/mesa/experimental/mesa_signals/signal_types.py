    This enum provides type-safe signal type definitions with IDE autocomplete support.

    Attributes:
        CHANGED: Emitted when an observable's value changes.

    Examples:
        >>> from mesa.experimental.mesa_signals import Observable, HasObservables, SignalType

    Inherits from str for backward compatibility with existing string-based code.
    Includes all list-specific signals (INSERTED, APPENDED, REMOVED, REPLACED) plus
    a SET signal for when the entire list is modified.

    Attributes:
        SET: Emitted when the list itself is replaced/assigned.
        INSERTED: Emitted when an item is inserted into the list.
        APPENDED: Emitted when an item is appended to the list.
        REMOVED: Emitted when an item is removed from the list.

    Examples:
